# Andersen DevOps Course
##### By Sergii Bilak

# About me
Working as FullStack web-developer for the last 8 years, current stack: PHP/Node.js for back-end; native HTML with jQuery/Angular/React for front-end.

### Why I'm interested in course
- Have some experience in Linux server setup and want to extend my knowledge;
- A lot of things our DevOps currently do looks like a magic;
- Looking forward to some career growth.

### My expectations from course:
- Extend my knowledge about databases replication/optimisation;
- Get new experience how to setup/work with high-load systems;
- Learn plenty of new technologies which I'm using but don't understand how it works.
